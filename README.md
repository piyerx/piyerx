## ■ About Me
I am a Computer Science engineer focused on building robust cloud-native systems and backend infrastructure. With professional experience as a mobile developer and a deep competency in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, I build software that is both scalable and efficient.

**Technical Highlights:**
* **Core Engineering:** Strong command of **Java** and **C++** with a focus on Data Structures & Algorithms. I have explored low-level computing by engineering a custom **LC-3 Virtual Machine**.
* **Cloud & AI:** Proficient in architecting solutions on GCP and integrating Generative AI (LLMs) into production workflows.
* **Innovation & Speed:** Proven ability to ship award-winning code, recognized as a **4x Hackathon Winner** (including *HackHazards* and *HackASol*) for projects in Web3 and Fintech.

I am looking to bring this technical rigor to a Cloud Infrastructure or Backend SDE role at a product-focused company that values problem-solving and architectural depth.

## ■ Engineering & Projects

### LC-3 Virtual Machine | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/Project-Synero/vm-lc3)
A low-level simulation of the LC-3 computer architecture written in C.
* **The Tech:** C, Makefile, Unix Systems
* **Key Challenge:** Implemented the full instruction cycle (Fetch, Decode, Execute) and memory-mapped I/O, requiring deep management of bitwise operations and registers.
* **Outcome:** Successfully simulates trap routines and opcode processing, demonstrating systems-level programming capability.

### Adhikar (Decentralized Land Registry) | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/piyerx/hashmap_hackasol25)
*Winner - Web3 Track at HackASol 4.0* <br>
A blockchain-based registry system to secure tribal land rights using immutable records.
* **The Tech:** Solidity, React, Node.js, IPFS
* **Key Challenge:** Engineered a "5-of-5" multi-signature consensus model to prevent unauthorized land transfers, ensuring unanimous community validation.
* **Outcome:** Deployed on Sepolia Testnet with a verified 500+ user capacity architecture.

### Nexora (Web3 Platformer) | [Link to Repo](https://github.com/piyerx/nexora)
*Top 25 - HackHazards 2025* <br>
A 2D platformer that integrates on-chain achievement tracking.
* **The Tech:** JavaScript, Ethers.js, Hardhat, Monad Testnet
* **Key Challenge:** Bridging the gap between real-time game physics (60 FPS) and asynchronous blockchain transactions for achievement verification.
